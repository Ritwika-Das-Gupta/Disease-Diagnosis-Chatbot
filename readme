# Disease Diagnosis Chatbot

The Disease Diagnosis Chatbot is a multilingual chatbot designed for accurate disease diagnosis using advanced technologies such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). This project explores the foundational concepts of ML, NLP, and model optimization to develop an efficient and user-friendly healthcare solution.

## Features

- ***Machine Learning (ML):*** Utilizes ML algorithms to analyze patterns within a dataset and make accurate predictions based on input symptoms.
  
- ***Natural Language Processing (NLP):*** Employs NLP techniques to understand and interpret human language, enabling conversational interactions with users.

- ***RoBERTa Model:*** Incorporates the state-of-the-art RoBERTa model for exceptional language understanding and disease prediction.

- ***Dataset Preprocessing:*** Ensures the quality of the training dataset by cleaning, formatting, and categorizing symptoms and diseases.

- ***Fine-tuning:*** Adapts the pre-trained RoBERTa model to the disease diagnosis task, enhancing its understanding of medical terminology and context.

- ***Java Gateway:*** Facilitates integration with external applications for seamless communication and interoperability.
